          By not specifying a USER, a program in the container may run as 'root'. This is a security  
          hazard. If an attacker can control a process running as root, they may have control over the
          container. Ensure that the last USER in a Dockerfile is a USER other than 'root'.

          Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string. This is usually bad practice     
          because manual construction could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker could   
          use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a parameterized 
          query which is available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, consider using an
          object-relational mapper (ORM) such as SQLAlchemy which will protect your queries.

          Detected Flask route directly returning a formatted string. This is subject to cross-site   
          scripting if user input can reach the string. Consider using the template engine instead and
          rendering pages with 'render_template()'.

          Detected the use of eval(). eval() can be dangerous if used to evaluate dynamic content. If
          this content can be input from outside the program, this may be a code injection           
          vulnerability. Ensure evaluated content is not definable by external sources.
